- no active downgrade option
- price: varibale
- premium users can subscribe for a period of time( eg. for one month, six month, one year, etc.) one get different offers (eg. one month costs 50 \$, but 1 year only  400 \$)


#### Gui - bootstrap
- Everything should be in english
- rename home with homepage
- display of add: describtion should be visible (in homepage)
- one the right of add: contact information
- layout of add important
- usability: highlight home( where am I?) 
- think of a good hierarchy for navigation


#### Search Criterias 
- move out date: leave it
- preferrences: remove it
- filter search: we can search for every attribute. ( the most important attribute on top, others below) we can search for a range(eg. number of rooms: min=5, max=7) if no maximum is entered, there should be a default value for max (eg. number of rooms: min=5, max = 100( per default) or per default numbers of roooms min = 1, if nothing is entered in min)
- don't force to input everyting for searching -> implement default values!
- Main search form: Only the most important attributes should be there, like pricee tc. But we can decide which to put there.

#### Place Ad
- move up description field ( on 1. position) and then the rest like number of rooms, etc. 

#### Name
Ithaca -> customer likes it ( Ithaca choosen as our Projectname)


#### Which features are most important for v2.0?
customer wants a basic version of everything(minimum vital product, minimal core functionality). That means:

- basics of auction should be implemented ( he wants to be able to bid, etc.)
- every page should have the same layout( all pages should be done with bootstrap)
- be able to post add, search for an add, etc.
- distinction of premium user and normal user
